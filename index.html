          <h2><u>My Top Three Personal Values</u></h2>
          <div>
              <h3><u>Integrity</u></h3>
              <p>Integrity is an important part of my character as it builds trust with people, strengthens my reputation, and encourages accountability on my part.</p>
              <p>I developed this value by listening to my parents as often as I could, learning discipline, boundaries, and socializing a lot during adolescence.</p>
              <p>Integirty is important to uphold, as if you don't, others may no longer believe in you or count on you, whether in friendships, family, or work.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
              <h3><u>Hard Work</u></h3>
              <p>Hard work is a key driver in reaching personal, academic, or professional goals. Through hard work, people improve their abilities and gain experience.</p>
              <p>I came to realize hard work is important when I realized after I was shot, that life will throw everything it can at me, and failure is part of learning. I took my experience and made it into something to drive me further.</p>
              <p>If you don't vitalize hard work, you end up with missed potential. You limit your own growth, skills, and accomplishments by avoiding challenge or effort.</p>
          </div>
           <div>
              <h3><u>Compassion</u></h3>
              <p>Compassion creates bonds between people. When we show care, others feel valued and understood, which strengthens relationships.</p>
              <p>I developed compassion by putting myself in others' shoes, seeing that if I was in their situation, I would want people to come to my aid as well.</p>
              <p>People feel dismissed, misunderstood, or hurt when compassion is absent. I can create cold or toxic environments, which can truly bring a person down.</p>
           </div>
           <div>
            <h3><u>Self-Discipline</u></h3>
            <p>Self-Discipline creates people who are self-sufficient, have individuality, and are able to support not only themselves, but other people as well.</p>
            <p>I learned self-discipline when I was shot and in the hospital, and had to learn how to adjust to my new life. Even though I would be sad, stiff, and acting out most days because I was truly hurting inside, but I realized that I can't make my pain, everyone else's pain.</p>
            <p>Without discipline, goals remain dreams. There's little progress or growth. Undisciplined behavior (e.g., emotional outbursts, unreliability) strains trust and connection.</p>
